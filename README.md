# Code to compute Eulerian coherent structures for flows on curved surfaces
Coherent structures offer a method to quantify the material transport and deformation properties of flows [1](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141322). This repo contains MATLAB code to compute Eulerian coherent structures for flows on curved surface. Details regarding the method used to compute these quantities is given in the accompanying paper [S. Santhosh, C. Zhu, B. Fencil, M. Serra](). The tutorial on how to use this code is described in the [documentation](https://sreejithsanthosh.github.io/FTLEhub/docs/Tutorials/FTLECurvedSurface.html)
